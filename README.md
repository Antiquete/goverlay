# GOverlay
GOverlay is an opensource project that aims to create a Graphical UI to help manage Linux overlays. It still in early alpha, so here will be dragons ! Be warned ! :)

This project is only possible due to the hard work of other people that did the really heavy lighting, i am just a Network Engineer that realy likes Linux and Gaming.
